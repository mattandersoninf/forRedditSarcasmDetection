# an example dataset has compiled comments from the following subreddits
# AskReddit, politics, worldnews, leagueoflegends, pcmasterrace, news, funny, pics, todayileanred, GlobalOffensive, AlexJones, The_Donald, JoeRogan, vegan, Overwatch, apexlegends, CallOfDuty, ukpolitics, oddlysatisfying, conspiracy, AskAnAmerican, DotA2, wow, firstworldanarchists, youtubehaiku, Whatcouldgowrong, LivestreamFail, FIFA, cringe, uncensorednews, worldpolitics, JusticeServed, showerthoughts, leagueoflegends, BlackPeopleTwitter, space, DestinyTheGame, TopMindsOfReddit, FloridaMan, ImGoingToHellForThis, anime_irl, cringe, BigBrother

# remember to add a condition that verifies if the subreddit still exists

# [pics, uncensorednews] don't work, expel for now

# pics for example throws the following exception "prawcore.exceptions.NotFound: received 404 HTTP response", will review later

# response 404 means that the resource does not exist. look further into what could have been removed from reddit

# response 504 reddit is under heavy pressure, or you're trying to throw up a cooment into reddit's database (which this script does not do at all)
